# Employee Web Project (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)

This is a client-side **Employee Management** application built with plain HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.
It demonstrates CRUD operations, searching, sorting, filtering and using `localStorage` to persist data — mirroring the SQL project behavior in a front-end app.

## Files
- `index.html` — single-file app. Open in a browser to run.
- `employees.json` — optional exported dataset (if you import/export from the app).

## Features
- Add / Edit / Delete employees
- Inline validation
- Search and filter by name or department
- Sort by columns
- Export / Import JSON
- Reset storage

## How to run
1. Download `index.html` and open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2. Use the form to add employees. Data is saved in browser `localStorage`.
3. Export JSON to share or import on another device.

## Purpose
This front-end project complements my SQL project by demonstrating how data can be handled on the client side and presented to users, showing end-to-end understanding of data flow and CRUD operations.
